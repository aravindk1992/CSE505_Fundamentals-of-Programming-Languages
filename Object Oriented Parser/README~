OBJECT ORIENTED PARSING

The following is an object oriented top-down parser in Java that translates a TinyPL program into an equivalent sequence
of java byte code for a Java Virtual Machine

The Grammar for TinyPL (using EBNF notation) is as follows:

 program ->  decls stmts end
 decls   ->  int idlist ;
 idlist  ->  id { , id } 
 stmts   ->  stmt [ stmts ]
 cmpdstmt->  '{' stmts '}'
 stmt    ->  assign | cond | loop
 assign  ->  id = expr ;
 cond    ->  if '(' rexp ')' cmpdstmt [ else cmpdstmt ]
 loop    ->  while '(' rexp ')' cmpdstmt  
 rexp    ->  expr (< | > | =) expr
 expr    ->  term   [ (+ | -) expr ]
 term    ->  factor [ (* | /) term ]
 factor  ->  int_lit | id | '(' expr ')'
