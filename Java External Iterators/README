The following code implements an external iterator for inorder traversal of a generic binary search tree (BST),
The following implementation uses this iterator to define the equality of two BSTs.
The external iterator is generic and supports two public methods: a boolean function
done(), which tests whether the iterator has any more values to yield, and a function next(), which
returns the next value if the iterator is not yet done. It contains other helper methods, which
are declared private.
The equality test is made to repeatedly obtain one value from each tree, in alternating fashion, and
compared with these values for equality. It returns false if the values are not equal (mismatch). If there
are no mismatches and the iterators are done at the same time, the equality test returns true.
